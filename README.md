# Swancat

A program that pipes together generators and effects
from my [synth package](https://github.com/graue/synth)
to create random soundscapes.

See also [Boodler](http://boodler.org),
a recent discovery which motivated me
to release this old code.

## Dependencies

 * [synth utilities](https://github.com/graue/synth)
 * `fadef` and `dbtorat` from
   [graue-utils](https://github.com/graue/graue-utils)

All of the above must be in your path.
Swancat calls these programs from a shell
to generate the sounds it pieces together.
