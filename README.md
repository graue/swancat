# Swancat

A program that pipes together generators and effects
from my [synth package](https://github.com/graue/synth)
(which this depends on and must be in your path)
to create random soundscapes.

See also [Boodler](http://boodler.org),
a recent discovery which motivated me
to release this old code.
